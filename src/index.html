      <p>
        There are tons of Mobile apps available to users of various categories and it's important to know what insights they provide.
        The dataset contains price, rating, genre, and other information about the app. This analyses 7200 available in the
        iOS App Store to answers the following questions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>What does the overall dataset show?</li>
        <li>How does the price impact the number of reviews and their rating?</li>
        <li>How does the content rating affect the overall app rating?</li>
      </ol>

        <h3 class="align-center">Overview</h3>
        <p>The overview shows the app categories, the number of apps, reviews, rating average, and price average. The majority
          of the apps are games which have a relatively average total number of reviews. Medical apps have the lowest number of reviews
          and the highest price average. Productivity apps have the highest user rating average. Feel free to explore the
          overview table below:</p>

        <h3 class="align-center">Categories by average number of reviews and price</h3>
        <p>
          The scatterplot below shows the pricing and number of rating average for each of the categories analyzed. One interesting
          find is how Social Networking apps have the highest number of average rating and the lowest price average. On the
          other hand, Medical apps have the highest pricing and therefore get fewer reviews. Music apps appear to be in between
          since they have a relatively high price and number of ratings. Hover over the data points below for more information:
