        <p>The overview shows the app categories, the number of apps, reviews, rating average, and price average. The majority
          of the apps are games which have a relatively average total number of reviews. Medical apps have the lowest number
          of reviews and the highest price average. Productivity apps have the highest user rating average. Feel free to
          explore the overview table below:</p>

        <h3 class="align-center">Categories by average number of reviews and price</h3>
        <p>
          The scatterplot below shows the pricing and number of rating average for each of the categories analyzed. One interesting
          find is how Social Networking apps have the highest number of average rating and the lowest price average. On the
          other hand, Medical apps have the highest pricing and therefore get fewer reviews. Music apps appear to be in between
          since they have a relatively high price and number of ratings. Hover over the data points below for more information:

        <p>
          The treemap below shows how apps with rating 9+ has the highest rating average. On the otherhand, apps rating 17+ have the
          lowest average rating. This result of both cases can be due to the number of apps per category.
