          The layout of this visualization is simple and in a hybrid structure. A table was used because it made it easier for the
          user to see the various parameters being displayed. It starts with an overview table of the data being analyzed
          with the following parameters: category, number of apps, number of reviews, average user rating, and average price.
          As for triggers, the user has the ability to also sort by those parameters by clicking on the table header. There
          are also sorting symbols to show the direction of the data.

        <h2 class="align-center">Categories by Average Number of Reviews and Price</h2>
        <p>
          In this scene, we present the user with a scatterplot. This type of chart was selected due to an easier way to show the data
          to the user without overwhelming them. We show categories, average price, and the average number of ratings in
          the parameters. For symbols, we use a circle colored different by category. We use a hover over effect which triggers
          a tooltip with detailed information on the data point.

        <h2 class="align-center">Age and App Rating</h2>
        <p>
          In this scene, we present the user with a treemap. This type of chart was chosen because it easily shows which age ratings
          have the highest reviews by the size of each map section. The parameters in this scene are age average app rating
          with respective labels on each. There are colors being showed to distinguish each map easily.
